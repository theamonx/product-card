## Overview

This challenge is given to me by my mentor, and he specifically told me to use bulma css. This challenge is about designing a responsive product card for 2 general widths, desktop and mobile.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Bulma CSS with SASS


### What I learned

 Althought I learned various things while designing it but the main thing I learned is that Bulma CSS sucks, No offend but their official documentaion is very consize and not clear enough, no coummunity support either. I tried my level best to design it as precise as I can.



### Continued development

I although hate bulma but I got to learn about SASS and I am going to try my next frontend project with tailwind CSS.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my mentors from [internpluss](https://www.internpluss.com)
I would like to thank Google Search Engine, Stackoverflow and Whatsapp's meta AI... although meta did not help much but it was still better than Bulma official documentation.
